// How do you change the height of the card element
// How do you change the placeholder text color
// How do you change the main text color
// How to display errors
// Maybe get to changing the font

// Here I'm calling out that these styes are injected by Stripe.js
// into the input element that's within an iframe. This is a common
// point of confusion for users. When the element first mounts it
// won't inherit any styles from the parent window because styles
// don't cascade into embedded iframes, so you have to use the style
// option:

// validation error on submit
// show error
// is processing state on the button
// paymen intent
// webhook
